# Hexagonal Architecture Server

## Overview

The **Hexagonal Architecture Server** is a robust backend solution built around the principles of **Hexagonal Architecture** (also known as **Ports and Adapters**). This project is designed to provide a clean, scalable, and maintainable approach to backend software development. It demonstrates the application of **Clean Architecture** and design patterns, with a strong focus on modularity, testability, and extensibility.

By adhering to these principles, the project showcases how to build a backend system that is both easy to test and extend, while ensuring separation of concerns and clear system boundaries.

## Key Features

### **Hexagonal Architecture Implementation**
The system follows **Hexagonal Architecture** principles, which separate the core domain logic from external systems and interfaces. This results in improved modularity, easier testing, and more maintainable code.

### **Decoupled Layers**
The application is structured into well-defined layers, including **Domain**, **Application**, **Adapters**, and **Ports**. This promotes separation of concerns and enhances the maintainability and clarity of the codebase.

### **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
The project follows **TDD** practices, with an emphasis on **unit** and **integration tests** to ensure code reliability, robustness, and correct behavior across different layers of the application.

### **Flexible Integration**
The server is designed for easy integration with various external systems, such as **databases**, **APIs**, and **third-party services**, through well-defined adapters and ports. This enables the application to remain adaptable and extensible.

### **Scalability and Extensibility**
The architecture supports seamless modifications and extensions, allowing new features or external systems to be integrated without disrupting the existing functionality.

### **Clean Code Principles**
The codebase follows **Clean Code** practices to ensure readability, maintainability, and ease of collaboration. Emphasis is placed on clear, concise code, proper documentation, and adherence to industry best practices.

## Tech Stack

This project leverages the following technologies:

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 3.3.0**
- **Maven**
- **PostgreSQL**

## Project Structure

The application is organized into several distinct layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains the core business logic, independent of any external systems.
- **Application Layer**: Acts as the intermediary between the domain logic and the outer layers.
- **Adapters**: External systems such as databases, APIs, and other services interact with the core system through well-defined adapters.
- **Ports**: Interfaces that define the contracts for interactions with external services, ensuring loose coupling and scalability.

This separation enables testing and evolving each component independently while maintaining a well-organized system architecture.

# Hexagonal Server

## Running the Application

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6+
- MongoDB running on localhost:27018 (or configured port)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Make the script executable (first time only)
chmod +x app-run.sh

# Run the application
./app-run.sh
```

The script will:
1. Build all modules (including account-app)
2. Install dependencies to local Maven repository
3. Start the application on port 8080 with 'local' profile

### Manual Build & Run

If you prefer to run commands manually:
```bash
# Build all modules
mvn clean install

# Run the application
cd app
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

### Run with Different Profiles

Edit `app-run.sh` and change the profile:
```bash
# For dev profile
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev

# For production profile
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=prod
```

### Run on Different Port
```bash
cd app
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--server.port=8081"
```

### Application URLs

- Application: http://localhost:8080
